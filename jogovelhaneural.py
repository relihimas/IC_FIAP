# episodes - a number of games we want the agent to play.
# gamma - aka decay or discount rate, to calculate the future discounted reward.
# epsilon - aka exploration rate, this is the rate in which an agent randomly decides its action rather than prediction.
# epsilon_decay - we want to decrease the number of explorations as it gets good at playing games.
# epsilon_min - we want the agent to explore at least this amount.
# learning_rate - Determines how much neural net learns in each iteration.
